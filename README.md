# Trashtype

## Description

Trashtype is a web application developed during the CUNY John Jay Hackathon in a team of 3 within a 24-hour timeframe. It utilizes a webcam to scan objects and categorize them into garbage, compost, or recycle using HTML, CSS, and TensorFlow.js.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- TensorFlow.js

## How it Works

Trashtype accesses the webcam to scan objects in real-time. TensorFlow.js models are used for object detection and classification, determining whether the object belongs in the garbage, compost, or recycle bin.

## Usage

To use Trashtype, simply open the application in a web browser with webcam support. Point your webcam towards the object to be categorized, and Trashtype will automatically classify it.
